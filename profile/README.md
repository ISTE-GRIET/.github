# Welcome to ISTE @ GRIET 🚀

Hey there! 👋 We're the ISTE crew at GRIET, and we're all about tech, fun, and learning!

## What's the Scoop?

We're a bunch of tech enthusiasts making waves on campus. From coding craziness to cool non-tech stuff, we're here to spice up your student life.

## Our Mission

We're on a mission to make tech and learning cool again. No boring stuff here! We want to create a kickass community that's all about having a good time, solving problems together, and maybe learning a thing or two along the way.

## What's in the Mix?

- 🚀 **Tech Playground:** Dive into the latest tech trends with our hands-on events.
- 🌈 **No Borders:** We're not just a club; we're part of a worldwide movement to shake up education.
- 🤝 **The Squad:** Hang out with awesome people, share your wild ideas, and maybe start the next big thing.
- 📚 **Geek Out with ISTE Standards:** We've got some standards, but trust us, they're cool.
